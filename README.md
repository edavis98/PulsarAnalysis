# PulsarAnalysis

Project creator: Evan Davis

This repository contains the 2D and 3D visualizations and animations created from analyzing a 3D particle-in-cell simulation of a pulsar magnetosphere.

The .py files used to create those visualizations are also in the repository.
  - pulsar_particles.py
  - relativistic_trajectory.py
  
The original data file allprt01_125113.dat was too large to be uploaded to github, so instead the git-lfs (large file storage) was used.
.gitattributes is the LFS transformed data file.
